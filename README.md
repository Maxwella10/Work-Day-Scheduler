# ðŸ“… Work Daily Planner  ðŸ“…
Overview 
Welcome to the Daily Planner App project!  Create a simple calendar application that empowers users to manage their daily schedule effectively. The app allows users to add important events to each hour of the day and provides an intuitive user experience with dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Day.js library is used for precise date and time manipulation, ensuring accurate and user-friendly time management.

## Instructions 
To use the Daily Planner App:

Open the Daily Planner App in your web browser.

The current day is prominently displayed at the top of the calendar when you open the planner.

Scroll down to view time blocks for standard business hours.

Each time block is color-coded: past, present, or future.

Click on a time block to enter an event.

After entering an event, click the "Save" button in that time block to store the event in local storage.

Your events persist even after refreshing the page.

Effortlessly manage your daily schedule and stay organized!
